# Please Don't Unfollow Me

One day, I accdiently found that one friend that I thought I was close to had unfollowed me, while I was still following him on Instagram. It made me wonder how many other people have done the same thing and I'm still following them without realizing it. It was a little bit hurtful to see the list of people who had unfollowed me at the end.

## Installation

`pip3 install instaloader`
If your IDEs do not work with instaloader, then close them and re-open them.

## Usage

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the folder where the Python file is located.
2. Run the `plzDontUnfollowMe.py` using the following command:
    * `python3 plzDontUnfollowMe.py <username> <password>`
    * Replace `username` and `password` with your Instagram username and password.
    * Running this command will create a `data.json` file in the same folder as the Pythone file. This file contains a list of your Instagram followers and followings.
3. Run the python file again using the command as before to get a list of people that you currently follow, but who had unfollowed you sadly.
4. Once you've identified the people you want to remove, delete the previous two JSON files. Then, follow steps 1-3 again to generate new JSON files with updated data.
